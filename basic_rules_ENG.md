## Dungeons and Dragons Organized Play Kraków: player rules (season 2)

English version 2.0 (July 2023)

This file doesn't contain the Advanced Rules, which you can find in a separate file. The purpose of the Advanced Rules is to clarify edge cases in Basic Rules, explain where the rules come from and describe rules for the Dungeon Master. If you just want to play in a game, the first two chapters ('Character Generation' and "How the Game is Played') will suffice. If you have questions, the Dungeon Master and other more experienced players can help you. Chapters 3 and 4 describe how to develop your character and what they can do between games. At the end of this file are tables with useful information.

If you have any questions or require any rules clarified, we invite you to our Discord Server (https://discord.com/invite/BWYKVxk) and point you towards the channel #rules-opk.

### I. Basic Rules<a name="zasady-podstawowe"></a>

OPK season 2 began on the 1st of August 2022. Whatever happened before is not relevant to games played in the 2nd season (most importantly, characters who played in OPK games before season 2 began are not permitted to play).

## 1. Character creation<a name="tworzenie-postaci"></a>

### 1.1 Start<a name="start"></a>

You need to create at least one character to play in OPK. You may have as many as you'd like, but you may only sign up with one to any particular game. If any part of the character creation process is unclear, we point you to the channel #tworzenie-postaci on the Discord.

Each new character for OPK starts at 1st Level. If this is your first character for DnD 5th edition (2014 rules, not 2024), we'd recommend using only races, classes, spells and feats in the Player's Handbook, as all of them are permitted to play. The races, classes, subclasses, spells and feats from the following sources can be used for character creation and development:

- Player's Handbook (PHB)
- Elemental Evil Player's Companion (EEPC)
- Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide (SCAG)
- Volo's Guide to Monsters (VGtM)
- Xanathar's Guide to Everything (XGtE)
- Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes (MToF)
- Tasha's Cauldron of Everything (TCoE)
- Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft (VRGtR) (lineages: Dhampir, Hexblood i Reborn are available only as standalone races, not templates to add to a different race)
- Wild Beyond the Witchlight (WBtW)
- Fizban's Treasury of Dragons (FToD)
- Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse (MP:MotM)
- Locathah Rising
- Tortle Package
- One Grung Above
- The Lunar Sorcerer subclass from Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen (DL:SotDQ)
- The Path of the Giant subclass and feats from Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants (BP:GotG)
- feats from Planescape: Adventures in the Multiverse (PS:AitM) (the Scion of the Outer Planes feat campaign restriction does not apply)

The following character options are **NOT** allowed:

- Custom Lineage (TCoE)
- Changeling race (MP:MotM)
- Shifter race (MP:MotM)
- backgrounds from BP:GotG and PS:AitM

Some races appear in more than one version in the sources above (e.g. simultaneously in VGtM/MToF and MP:MotM). In such cases, the player may choose which version to use.

Races with permanent flight speed (e.g. Aarakocra, Fairy) may only start using it after hitting 5th Level. Until then, they are treated as not possessing a flight speed.

Optional rules and rules variants are usually not permitted in OPK games unless explicitly stated in our rules. We allow the following optional rules for Character Creation:

- Human Languages, Tiefling Variants (SCAG),
- Blessing of Corellon (MToF),
- Variant Human, feats, multiclassing (PHB),
- Customizing Your Origin (not Custom Lineage!), Optional Class Features (TCoE).

Attention! Choices made in character creation are NOT permanent. Until you play your first game of Tier 2, meaning your character is level 5 or above, we allow _character rebuilding_. That means after you finish a Tier 1 adventure you can freely change almost all mechanical and story aspects of your character: name, looks, age, personality, but also ability scores, skill proficiencies, race, class, spells and background - including the changes to your starting equipment from class and background. Money and equipment that your character acquired on adventures and between them are not changed. Rewards from adventures do not disappear, in particular the Story Awards, unless their requirements are no longer met after the rebuild. The level of the character does not change, and they must be created according to OPK and DnD character creation rules.
Any change to the aforementioned character aspects cancels any ongoing effects that are connected to the old character version, including spell effects, class features etc.

### 1.2 Ability scores and HP<a name="atrybuty"></a>

Ability scores can be assigned using two methods: Standard Array or Point Buy. Rolling for ability scores is not permitted.

- Standard Array means assigning the following scores to your abilities in any order: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.

- Point Buy is described in chapter 1 of the PHB as Variant: Customizing Ability Scores.

After assigning ability scores you add your racial ability score bonuses, determined by the rules of PHB, MoM or added freely using rules in TCoE, then you calculate your ability score modifiers according to the PHB.

Your starting Hit Points are determined by your class. When your character gains levels, they gain the average amount of Hit Points for the class they gained a level in. Rolling is not permitted.

### 1.3. Alignment, background and religion<a name="background"></a>

Your character's alignment cannot be Neutral Evil or Chaotic Evil. If it ever becomes that, the character becomes unplayable and cannot be used for OPK games.

After playing the first Tier 2 adventure, the character's official name cannot be changed (for organization purposes). Aside from that, the player has almost unlimited freedom in determining their character's non-mechanical aspects, such as their history, religion, notable features, looks, age, and so forth (as long as it doesn't contradict other rules and isn't aimed at deteriorating other player's enjoyment of the game). To maintain the spirit of the game, we ask for a modicum of common sense and at least a minimal amount of cohesion with the world of Faerun (which is a late-medieval-ish heroic fantasy setting with advanced magic and clear influences of supernatural beings, including deities).[^1]

In particular, you can choose a background from books mentioned in chapter 1.1., as well as the campaigns Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus, Curse of Strahd, Tomb of Annihilation, The Wild Beyond the Witchlight, Ghosts of Saltmarsh. You can choose the Athlete background from Mythic Odyssey of Theros, or create your own using rules in PHB (Customize Your Background).

### 1.4. Starting Equipment<a name="ekwipunek-startowy"></a>

Starting equipment and gold are determined by your character's class and background. You may not replace the default starting equipment with rolling for gold. You may, however, sell starting equipment at half its listed price in the PHB, and buy new equipment normally.

You may use the "This Is Your Life" tables from XGE. Rolling on the tables must be done either at a table in the presence of a DM, or on either the #tworzenie-postaci or #online-play channels on our Discord using the server's dice rolling bot.

## 2. How the game is played<a name="organizacja-sesji"></a>

### 2.1. Preparing for the game<a name="przygotowanie-do-sesji"></a>

All OPK games are announced on our portal [www.rpgkrakow.pl](http://www.rpgkrakow.pl/) by DMs (usually also on #ogłaszanie-sesji channel on our Discord). To join a game, you must book your slot on that game with a character you created. The games are separated by Tiers, which determines the level of player characters that can participate in them:

Tier 1 (T1): Levels 1 – 4

Tier 2 (T2): Levels 5 – 10

Tier 3 (T3): Levels 11 – 16

Tier 4 (T4): Levels 17 – 20

Thus, each character in OPK starts with a T1 game and advances through Tiers as they level up. On our Discord in #announcements you can toggle notifcations for upcoming games in Tiers you are interested in.

The DM announces on our portal which adventure (or adventures) will be played during that game. The list of allowed adventures is provided in the Katalog Przygód document (we discourage players from looking there due to potential spoilers). You should always check the adventure's code and title, because no character can play the same adventure twice (regardless of success or failure). The game's location is also provided: usually R'lyeh Cafe or online (using our Discord's voice chat and virtual tabletop tools like Roll20). Sometimes the DM includes additional information, like restrictions for signing up (e.g. new player priority) or special rules (e.g. session in English) - these rules should be acknowledged and followed.

The minimum required equipment for a player to join a game is a character sheet (or the knowledge of how to use it), a set of dice and something to indicate your character's position on the battlemat (e.g. a figurine or a token).

General Warning: the default language of OPK is Polish. If a game is ran in English, it is specifically announced as such. Some DMs and players are fluent enough in English that they can agree to switch languages, but this should be agreed upon in advance and is not guaranteed - some players or DMs might not be comfortable or confident enough in their English-speaking ability.

### 2.2. Beginning of the game<a name="rozpoczecie-sesji"></a>

At the start of a game, the DM collects information about the player characters. They decide (if it wasn't decided before) the adventure that will be played and the game time (in maximum ACP awarded - the abbreviation will be explained below).

Next, the players determine the equipment their characters will take on the session, as well as temporary benefits (aquired only for the duration of an adventure):

-You are not obligated to take all your equipment (including money) that the character owns (e.g. due to encumbrance limits). However, the equipment that the character has with them during an adventure should be clearly separated from the equipment left behind.

-Each character can take spell scrolls on an adventure, with the limitation that the sum of spell levels on the scrolls is not greater than the tier of the adventure multiplied by the game time expressed in ACP by the DM (e.g. a Tier 2 adventure with 4 ACP, the sum of spell levels on your spell scrolls must not be greater than 2*4=8, like 1 scroll of a 5th level spell and 1 scroll of a 3rd level spell, or 2 scrolls of 2nd level spells and 4 scrolls of 1st level spells)

-Each character may (but is not required to) begin the adventure with one of the benefits listed below, depending on the adventure's Tier:

Tier 1 (T1): Potion of Healing

Tier 2 (T2): Potion of Healing (Greater)

Tier 3 (T3): Potion of Healing (Superior)

Tier 4 (T4): Potion of Healing (Supreme)

These item benefits disappear at the end of an adventure regardless of whether they were used or not. With the DM's permission you may replace the potion's benefit with a single spell component or piece of equipment with a value equal to or less than the Tier's default potion (which is 50/100/500/5000 gp respectively). Additionally, the first time a player joins a game in OPK, their first character receives one regular Potion of Healing that will not be removed at the end of adventure unless consumed.

An advanced character may, with the DM's permission, begin the adventure under the effects of spells cast during previous adventures. Before the adventure starts, the player who wishes to use such effects should prepare a list of all continuous effects on the player character with all their variables (e.g. the trigger of Contingency spell, statblock and sourcebook of a bound creature, the effects of a Wish). The DM has the right to verify this list before adventure and disable such effects for the duration of the adventure they're running. Continuous effects not declared before adventure start cannot be used for that adventure. With the DM's permission, the character may cast a spell (like Find Familiar) before the adventure begins, keeping in mind the spell's cost.

The beginning of a game is also a great opportunity to inform the DM about any unusual magic items the character owns and inquire or clarify the DM's rulings for particular character aspects where base game rules are unclear.

### 2.3. Playing the game<a name="przebieg-sesji"></a>

In OPK, games are ran using Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition rules, without modifying the rules written in the books (so called _rules as written_ or RAW). The details of what we consider RAW can be found in Advanced Rules (in a separate file).

However, it is worth remembering that within the RAW (quoting the Dungeon Master's Guide) _The DM interprets the rules and decides when to abide by them and when to change them_, so a DM running a game is the ultimate arbiter regarding the interpretation or even ignoring of the rules. This does not mean that a DM can't be corrected (they are not infallible) if you think a mistake was made. However, the argument shouldn't be drawn out during a session if the DM stands by their decision.

During a game it is important to respect the fellow players (including the DM) and keep everyone's enjoyment of the game in mind as well as the general atmosphere at the table. Therefore, we ask that everyone adhere to and respect the DM's decisions and the other player's requests in this matter. Remember that DnD is a team game, and the player characters should all have the same goals and focus on that (though of course, they may argue about the methods).

It is forbidden to interfere with other character's material possessions. During an adventure, one character may lend another gold and items, but if they haven't been consumed before the end of the game (like scrolls, potions or spell components), they must be returned in full when the game ends (in case of gold lending, even if it was spent: it might require selling off equipment). In case the party needs to pay for services during an adventure (spellcasting, tipping in a tavern, bribes), the characters may split the costs however they please.

It is ESPECIALLY forbidden to behave in a way that sabotages the party goals or is directly harmful to other characters, without explicit permission from the players of those characters and the DM. If a player or their character acts against other players/characters or behaves aggressively, the DM may decide to punish them by disinviting them from the table, deleting their character or permanently disallowing them to join future OPK games.

### 2.4. End of the game<a name="zakonczenie-sesji"></a>

The GM determines the moment the adventure ends and how successful the party was (meaning what goals have been achieved by the party). They inform about the awards gained during adventure (described in the next chapter). Usually the rewards (except items) are split evenly, but the DM may decide otherwise based on what occurred during the game.

No later than when the rewards are handed out, a player can decide to reduce their character's rate of development for the adventure (the details can be found in Advanced Rules). A character with reduced rate of development does not take part in the distribution of magic items of uncommon or higher rarity.

The results of an adventure should be noted down in a character's logsheet by their owner (see [chapter 4.1](#logsheet))

## 3. Rewards and other consequences of an adventure<a name="nagrody"></a>

Characters receive rewards from the game as described by the DM at the end of an adventure. These are usually: ACP (Advancement Checkpoints), Downtime, money, magic and non-magic items, and Story Awards. In this chapter we will go through each of those rewards and their use, as well as discuss the negative effects of adventures that a character may experience.

Unless specified otherwise by the DM, all of the rewards from an adventure do not have to be spent immediately. The awarded downtime, money and items remain in the character's possession until used. ACP received from all total adventures are summed up to determine the character's current level.

### 3.1. ACP, Downtime (DT) and Money<a name="acp-dt-pieniadze"></a>

After each game, the player character receives ACP as determined by the DM, depending on how successful the party was in fulfilling the adventure's goals. Usually the whole party receives the same amount of ACP, but the DM can decide differently, especially if one character did not participate in parts of the adventure important for its success (they wandered off, were unconscious, etc.). The criteria for DMs to award ACP can be found in Advanced Rules.

A character advances to the next level if, after the DM awards them ACP for an adventure, the sum of their lifetime ACP awards is equal or greater than an appropriate threshold from Table 1 (part II of the rules). In short, Tier 1 characters reach the next level after gaining 4 ACP above the previous one. Characters in other Tiers require 8 ACP to reach the next level.

Downtime is awarded automatically alongside ACP, equal to 2.5 DT per 1 ACP. The usage of downtime is described in [chapter 4.3](#downtime).

The DM decides on the amount of gold the characters receive, in line with the Advanced Rules. As with ACP, the gold is split evenly between characters, although in extreme circumstances the DM may decide differently.

### 3.2. Material rewards - magic and non-magic items<a name="magitki"></a>

The reward in an adventure is often one or more magical items. In OPK, magical items are divided into:

a) Single-use or disposable items (commonly referred to as consumables, although this term sometimes causes confusion, so it will not be used in the rules from now on). Such items include items that lose their magical properties forever after a single use (potions, scrolls, some tattoos, elemental gems, etc.), magical ammunition (regardless of the amount specified in the adventure), i.e., bolts, arrows, and bullets for firearms, as well as smokepowder, and special items with a limited number of uses, specific to particular AL storylines (i.e., seasons), which must always be voted on before being added to the list of single-use items (the current list includes: Soul Coin, Balloon Pack, Wingwear).

b) Permanent items: all items that are not single-use. Please note that items with a finite number of uses greater than 1 (e.g., Keoghtom's Ointment, Gem of Brightness, Ring of Three Wishes) are permanent items for the purposes of this classification.

In addition, items can be classified according to rarity (common, uncommon, rare, very rare, legendary) in accordance with the general rules of DnD 5e. 

These classifications are primarily relevant when assigning magic items as rewards after a session (see below) and when exchanging magic items [(see Section 4.3 of the Basic Rules, first 2 points – only permanent items can be exchanged).](#downtime)

The distribution of magical items as rewards for adventures among player characters is managed by the Game Master, following the rules described in detail in chapter [3.2 Advanced Rules](advanced_rules.md#zaawansowane-przydzielanie-przedmiotow). From the player's perspective, it is enough to know that characters who can use a given item have priority in obtaining it, and secondly, in the case of permanent magical items of at least uncommon rarity, characters who have fewer such items have priority in receiving them, regardless of whether those items were taken on the adventure or not.

Therefore, keep in mind the number of permanent magical items of at least uncommon rarity assigned to the character participating in the adventure and provide this information upon request by the Game Master. According to the detailed arrangements, this number does not include a maximum of one of the following items: magical, generic +1 weapon; Wraps of Unarmed Prowess; Insignia of Claws, Uncommon.

We emphasize that common magical items (common rarity), single-use magical items, and non-magical items (if the adventure allows for them to be kept instead of sold) do not count towards the number of permanent magical items, and their possession is not relevant when assigning them as material rewards.

Note: Magical items, except for those that can lose their power according to DnD rules (e.g., staves, wands, single-use items, and items with a limited number of charges), cannot simply be removed from a character's inventory. It is impossible to permanently destroy, discard, sell for money, or otherwise dispose of them, reducing the number of permanent magic items owned, unless the adventure explicitly provides for such removal. The only acceptable option is to exchange them (or, in the case of weapons, reforge them) for other magical items in the manner described in [Chapter 4.4 of the Basic Rules.](#przekuwanie-broni)

### 3.3. Story Awards<a name="story-awards"></a>

Some adventures include Story Awards, which are benefits or drawbacks that do not usually have a material form that can influence the character's capabilities during the following adventures and downtime. Each Story Award has rules for its usage. They should be recorded on the character sheet or logsheet in case the DM wishes to look at it. If the player wants to actively use a Story Award during an adventure, they should call upon it and provide its description (as the DM is unlikely to know it). To use a Story Award during downtime, simply follow its description.

### 3.4. Negative events: diseases, curses and death<a name="smierc"></a>

Adventuring is not just all benefits. During their adventures, characters may suffer negative consequences of adventuring. If the character contracts a disease or is cursed during an adventure, the details of such curse or disease will be provided by the DM. Usually (unless the DM states otherwise) you can get rid of a disease or curse by casting an appropriate spell or using a spellcasting service.

During an adventure, it is possible that a character may die and is not brought back to life by an appropriate spell (Revivify, Raise Dead, Resurrection and similar) or by paying for an appropriate service. In such case, depending on the course of the adventure and cause of death, the DM can make one of the following decisions, and informs the player of it:

a) The character is permanently dead and cannot be used for OPK games.

b) The character is dead, but the body was recovered and delivered to a cleric. If the character has the funds (possibly after selling some of their equipment) to pay for an appropriate resurrection spell (Table 2 in part II), the character is brought back to life (following the spell's rules) and can take part in future games. If the character does not have such funds, they are permanently dead and cannot participate in OPK games.

c) The character is dead and their body was not recovered from the place of death. The body can be retrieved by the next adventuring party that successfully finishes the adventure that the character died on (see Advanced Rules). If this is successful, the character is considered to be in the same situation as outlined in b).

A dead character (regardless of whether the death is permanent or not) cannot perform any activities or gain any resources (this includes DM rewards) except paying for resurrection and selling off equipment for that purpose.

## 4. Character development between adventures<a name="pomiedzy-przygodami"></a>

### 4.1. Character logsheet<a name="logsheet"></a>

For every character, their player should create a logsheet that contains all changes to the character's possessions during and between adventures. A template for such logsheets can be found on our Discord on the #materialy\_dla\_graczy channel, but the logsheet can be of any format that is comfortable to the player. Importantly, the logsheet should provide information about what adventures the character took part in, who the DM was for those adventures, how they reached their current level and where their equipment (especially magic items) and Story Awards came from.

The character logsheet is primarily a helpful tool for the player. However, the DM may request information from the logsheet during a game. If a player is not able to present this information, or it conflicts with the character sheet, the DM can decide to exclude the controversial equipment (or in extreme cases, the character) from the game.

### 4.2. Buying and selling items, paid services<a name="uslugi"></a>

Between adventures, the characters may:
- purchase items from the Equipment chapter of Player's Handbook (at listed prices), spell components (at listed prices) and [potions and scrolls from tables 3 and 7 in part II of the rules.](#tabela-mikstury)

- coat non-magic weapons and ammunition with silver (100 gp per weapon or 10 pieces of ammunition) or adamantium (500 gp per weapon or 10 pieces of ammunition). A weapon can be coated by both materials.

- use spellcasting services ([according to Table 2 in part II of the rules](#tabela-spellcasting)). Attention! Casting spells between adventures on your own is prohibited. DM can allow for casting spells before an adventure, including cost in DT and other resources.

Additionally, the character may sell their items from the Equipment chapter of Player's Handbook at half the normal price. Magic items (including consumables) cannot be sold.

### 4.3. Using downtime<a name="downtime"></a>

The unit of downtime is one day and is denoted as DT. Accumulated downtime can be spent to:

**1. Exchange permanent magic items with other characters:**

With permission from both sides, two player characters (or even two characters of the same player) can exchange magic items. Each character must spent the exchange cost of 15 DT unless the characters meet on an adventure - the exchange is free in that case.

The characters can only exchange items of the same rarity (e.g. an uncommon item can only be exchanged for another uncommon item). Additionally, the character may only exchange items appropriate to their tier (Uncommon - T1, Rare - T2, Very Rare - T3, Legendary - T4), even if they somehow obtained a higher tier item before. You cannot exchange consumable magic items (e.g. scrolls, potions, ammunition) or expended magic items that have lost their magical properties.

All trades should be recorded on the Discord channel #bazar.

**2. Exchange permanent magic items with magic items for trade:** Permanent magic items can also be exchanged with the famous fence S. Wawelski at the “Dragon's Lair” pawn shop. Such exchanges do not require the consent of other players, and it is also possible to exchange a higher rarity item for a lower rarity item (e.g., rare for uncommon), but the list of items that can be obtained is significantly shorter, and in some cases, the cost is higher. Specific prices, a list of items that can be obtained in exchange, and restrictions on such exchanges can be found in [Table 5 of Part II of these rules](#tabela-lombard). Items given to the pawnshop as part of an exchange disappear into the dragon's treasury and will never be recovered.

**3. Level boosting:** At levels 4, 10, and 16 a character may spend downtime to advance one level to a higher Tier of play. The cost is 25, 75 and 150 DT.

The character receives the exact amount of ACP to gain a level, as per Table 1. ACP gained this way does not give DT or other benefits, except for the level-up.

**4. Returning from another plane:** If for whatever reason a character remains on a different plane of existence than they should at the end of an adventure, they can spend 50 DT to return (unless the adventure specifies a different cost). If at the end of the adventure the characters are supposed to be on a different plane of existence, returning to Material Plane is free for the next adventure (even if the adventure specifies otherwise, like adventures in Season 4).

**5.Copying spells:** (Only availiable to Wizards, Pact of the Tome Warlocks, characters with the Ritual Caster feat). This follows the base rules of copying spells. For each 8 hours of copying started by the character, the cost is 1 DT.

**6. Learning:** Spending 25 DT and 300 gold gives a character proficiency in a new language or tool.

**7. Using Story Awards:** Some adventures have Story Awards that require spending downtime. This is done according to the Story Award's description.

**8. Buying or creating a scroll:** A character proficient in Arcana that has spell slots or pacts slots and knows a spell can create a spell scroll with that spell. Any character can buy a spell scroll. The price and limitations for buying and creating a scroll can be found in table 4 in part II of the rules.

**9. Practicing a trade/crafting:** A character proficient in the Herbalism Kit can craft a Potion of Healing for 1 DT and 25 gp, a Potion of Greater Healing for 3 DT and 50 gp, a Potion of Superior Healing for 10 DT and 250 gp, and a Potion of Supreme Healing for 15 DT and 500 gp. Characters proficient in crafting tools are able to craft non-magic items (Weapons, Armor, Adventuring Gear, Vehicles) according to rules in PHB or XGE. The character decides which rules to use. Additionally, characters proficient in tools can use it according to the optional rules in XGE, chapter Tool Proficiencies. If the time required for the task is 1 hour or more, it can be done between adventures. For each 8 hours of work started by the character, the cost is 1 DT (if the task is done as part of a short or long rest, it is treated as taking 1 hour).

**10. Relax:** A character can spend 5 DT and maintain a comfortable lifestyle in that time (spending at least 10 gp). As a result of the rest and relaxation, the character gains inspiration. The character can only have one inspiration gained from this activity.

Activities that take less than 1 day can be combined with others for the purposes of determining cost. For example, a wizard can spend 6 hours copying spells and 2 hours using a tool they are proficient in, spending 1 DT total.

Regardless of downtime spending, it is assumed that a character has one long rest between adventures. Spending downtime for the above activities counts for the passage of time (e.g. for regaining Hit Dice, magic item charges, cooldown of abilities, recovering from resurrection).

**11. Repairing damaged armor/weapons:** When adventuring, suits of armor or weapons of a player character may be damaged in the form of reducing AC of an armor or attack/damage bonus of a weapon (typically, after encountering various oozes). In order to repair a damaged suit of armor or a damaged weapon, the character must spend an amount of downtime (DT) equal to the total penalty of all of the character's affected items. For example, if, at the end of the fight, a character's plate armor has a modified AC of 14 (-4 penalty), repairing the armor requires 4 DT. The same cost would apply to a weapon has a -4 penalty. After repairing, all the statistics of the equipment are the same as before the damage. Any equipment that was damaged and not repaired is worthless and cannot be sold. Suits of armor and weapons destroyed during the adventure may not be repaired. The DM has the final say on the ruling if the damaged suit of armor or weapon is repairable.

### 4.4. Reforging magic weapons<a name="przekuwanie-broni"></a>

A character that obtains a magic weapon has the ability to reforge it. It can be done only once, no later than at the start of the character's next adventure. Reforging magic weapons is free.

Reforging means changing the weapon's name to a different one from Simple Weapons and Martial Weapons table in PHB (e.g. longsword to maul). If the weapon's name appears in the magic item's description it is changed as well. Reforging results in the appropriate changes to the weapon's statistics, which include damage (type and dice), weight and properties. The weapon's magical properties remain the same (you cannot reforge a Vicious weapon into a Weapon of Warning, unless allowed by a separate rule), including whether it requires attunement or not. There is one exception: a weapon can be reforged into any +X weapon of the same or lower rarity.

The limitations to weapon reforging are as follows:

1) Weapons in table 5 "Weapon reforging list" in part 2 of the rules can only be reforged into weapons of the same type (in the same cell of the table). If the table has additional rules for reforging a particular weapon, they should be considered equally with the rules in this chapter. If the table specifically removes a restriction, it takes precedence over the rules in this chapter.

2) Weapons can only be reforged into weapons of equal or lesser rarity (e.g you can reforge a +2 weapon into a +1 weapon, but not a +1 weapon into a +2 weapon)

3) Weapons with the _thrown_ property can only be reforged into weapons with that same property. A weapon without the _thrown_ property cannot be reforged into one with that property (you cannot reforge a mace into a javelin and vice versa)

4) Weapons that are _ranged_ can only be reforged into other _ranged_ weapons. A weapon that is not _ranged_ cannot be reforged into one with that is (you cannot reforge a greataxe into a longbow and vice versa).

5) Weapons from the Simple Weapon table in PHB cannot be reforged into weapons from the Martial Weapon table in PHB (you cannot reforge a glaive into a quarterstaff - but the opposite is true).

6) Weapons without the _finesse_ property cannot be reforged into weapon with that property (you cannot reforge a longsword into a rapier - but the opposite is true).

Reforged magic weapons that are destructible by dealing damage (e.g. Net) and destroyed in such a way, automatically repair themselves at the end of adventure (before rewards are given) and are retrieved by the character.

### 4.5. Reforging magic ammunition<a name="przekuwanie-amunicji"></a>

Similarly to the rules in [chapter 4.4](#przekuwanie-broni) arrows can be reforged into bolts and vice versa, maintaining the magic properties of the ammunition (a +2 bolt can be changed into a +2 arrow, and an Arrow of X Slaying into Bolt of X Slaying).

Attention! The rules of season 2, Version 2 were introduced on 01.06.2023. Transition rules for characters that participated in adventures of a higher tier than T1 in season 2 before 01.06.2023 can be found in Advanced Rules, chapter 7. All other characters can continue playing in OPK without modification.

## 5. Magic items for trade<a name="tabela-lombard"></a>

Below are magic items that can be obtained by exchange (described in [chapter 4.3](#downtime)) with prices.

Magic items that are exchanged during that trade must be permanent and 'fully charged', meaning it is in as good of a condition as it was when found during the adventure. In particular, items with expendable charges (e.g. Gem of Brightness, Wand of Magic Missiles, patches in Robe of Useful Items), when exchanged, should have as many of those charges as they had when they were found on an adventure - otherwise they are not eligible for trade.

## 6. Weapon reforging list<a name="tabela-bronie"></a>

All weapons in the table abide by the restrictions in [chapter 4.4](#przekuwanie-broni), unless "Additional notes and restrictions" specifies otherwise.

| Weapon name | Additional notes and restrictions |
| --- | --- |
| Weapon +1/+2/+3 | Any weapon can be reforged into a +1/+2/+3 weapon (subject to general restrictions) by losing all magical properties of the original weapon and replacing them with an appropriate bonus to hit and damage. <br /> Weapons reforged into +1/+2/+3 weapons can gain the finesse trait. <br /> Wraps of Unarmed Prowess items of Uncommon rarity and Insignia of Claws count as Simple weapons for the purposes of reforging into +1/+2/+3 weapons.  |
| Flame Tongue | Can be reforged into any simple or martial weapon without _thrown_ i _ranged_ properties, in case of a longsword or greatsword also without the _finesse_ property. The resulting weapon cannot qualify for use with the Polearm Master feat (so it cannot be a glaive, halberd, pike or quarterstaff).|
| Javelin of Lightning | Can be reforged into any _simple_, _thrown_ weapon. |
| Moon-Touched Sword | Can be reforged into any simple or martial weapon without _thrown_ i _ranged_ properties, in case of a longsword or greatsword also without the _finesse_ property. |
| Sword of Wounding | Can be reforged into any simple or martial weapon without _thrown_ i _ranged_ properties, in case of a longsword or greatsword also without the _finesse_ property. |
| Vicious Weapon | - |
| Weapon of Warning | - |
| Vorpal Weapon | Can be reforged into any simple or martial weapon, without the thrown, ranged, or special traits, and in the case of a longsword or greatsword, also without the finesse trait. The target weapon cannot qualify for use with the Polearm Master feat (i.e., it cannot be a glaive, halberd, pike, or quarterstaff).|

# 7. Other items available for purchase<a name="tabela-inne"></a>

### Firearms:

Characters from Tier 2 and above have the option to purchase Renaissance firearms, as described in Chapter 9 of the DMG:

|        | Price  | Damage        | Weight | Properties                                     |
|--------|--------|---------------|--------|------------------------------------------------|
| Pistol | 250 gp | 1d10 piercing |  3 lb. |        Ammunition (range 30/90), loading       |
| Musket | 500 gp | 1d12 piercing | 10 lb. | Ammunition (range 40/120), loading, two-handed |

### Ammunition:

|              | Price | Weight |
|:------------:|:-----:|:------:|
| Bullets (10) |  3 gp |  2 lb. |

Ammunition for firearms consists of projectiles that are destroyed upon impact. Proficiency with firearms requires an ability that specifies this type of weapon by name in its description, such as the Gunner feat or the Artificer class. For purposes other than determining proficiency, such weapons are treated as martial weapons.
If a reward or rule allows you to obtain a weapon, e.g., a magical one, paying the above cost in gold allows you to obtain the firearm version, provided it meets all the restrictions of such a rule or reward. Such magical weapons cannot be exchanged with Tier 1 characters.

**Example:** If we exchange an item for a +1 weapon according to the rule described in [Chapter 4.3 of the basic rules](#downtime), after paying an additional 500 gp, a musket is a legal choice for this weapon.
