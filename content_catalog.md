fortresses smash down upon the defenseless metropolises. What aid can be enlisted when such

**Informacje o przygodzie**
Minsc and his faithful ally Boo have seen much of the Forgotten Realms, and have been inspired by
Volo to produce a guidebook detailing some of the more incredible things that they've experienced!
From the magic-infused cuisine of the Lantan Isles to the designers of massive urban frescos (well,
they call them frescos but everyone else recognizes graffiti when they see it) to the divinely
apathetic and beyond, these pages are told from Minsc's point of view. Because of this flawed
recollection, the character options contained on these pages are only allowed in campaign play if
additional, official documentation is acquired or when playing the included adventure.

Runtime - przygoda składa się z dwóch części po około 4h. Po pierwszej z nich można przydzielić graczom 4ACP oraz zebrane złoto. Magiczne przedmioty pochodzą w całości z części drugiej.
Złoto - nie wymaga zmian.
Magiczne przedmioty - przygoda zawiera 1 common, 2 uncommony i 2 rare. Najmniej integralne dla fabuły są uncommony (Pipes of Haunting i Mithral Plate) i to je należy usunąć aby sprowadzić magiczne przedmioty do standardowej ilości. Zarówno zmodyfikowany Cloak of the Bat jak i unikatowa broń nie zaburzają balansu i mogę być dane jak opisane w przygodzie.

### [To Wake The Leviathan](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/242840/To-Wake-The-Leviathan)

**Informacje o przygodzie**
A RACE AGAINST TIME THROUGH THE RAVAGES OF THE BLOOD WAR
Across the infinite layers of the Lower Planes, a band of heroes desperately hunts for the whereabouts of an ancient weapon — one that could very well turn the tide of the eternal Blood War.

With the help of the archmage Mordenkainen, these adventurers must stop the great Leviathan from falling into fiendish hands. Can they unlock the mysteries of the war machine before it's too late?

To Wake The Leviathan is a 4-6 hour D&D Adventurer's League module for character levels 11-16, It is part of a series of adventures that expands upon the material presented in Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes™. It can be played on it's own or as a part of any D&D campaign.

Przygoda przewiduje runtime 4-6h, ale nie ma wydzielonych Bonus Objectives, więc decyzja o przydzieleniu ACP powinna należeć do DMa (maksymalnie 6 ACP). Złoto nie wymaga zmian, jest adekwatne do gry na t3. Liczba magicznych przedmiotów: należy zredukować liczbę magicznych przedmiotów, usuwając ring of cold resistance (encounter ze smokiem), usuwając możliwość stworzenia permanentnych magicznych przedmiotów w kuźni (circlet of blasting albo sentinel shield, ale zostawiając możliwość stworzenia potion of superior healing). Pozostałe dwa przedmioty są zależne od przebiegu rozgrywki:
Dragon scale mail (VR)- o rodzaju decyduje rzut d10. Przedmiot można pominąć (wymaga zwycięstwa w encounterze z limitem czasowym).
Boots of speed (R) LUB Boots of the winterlands (U)*- w zależności od podjętych w przygodzie decyzji 

Należy mieć na względzie, że przygoda nie zawiera wszystkich statblocków (tylko customowe stat blocki potworów spoza oficjalnych źródeł) oraz nie ma propozycji skalowania encounterów. 
DM odblokowuje tylko wylosowany przez party wariant Dragon Scale Maila albo losuje go po sesji na kanale ⁠spam_z_sesji (jeśli drużyna pominęła ten przedmiot). 


### [The Lich-Queen’s Begotten](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/242645/The-LichQueens-Begotten)

Runtime - Przygoda jest na 4h dla postaci 1-2lvl, w razie konieczności należy dopełnić losowymi encounterami z opisanych w przygodzie.
Złoto - Brak nagród w złocie, co jest celowe i uzasadnione. Nie należy dawać złota wg. tabelki, co wynagradza nadmiarowa liczba magicznych przedmiotów.
Magiczne przedmioty - Przygoda zawiera 2 przedmioty common (jest też 3, mystery key który powinien być zużyty w trakcie przygody i nie jest nagrodą) i jeden rare. Z racji na obecne zasady przekuwania rarity przedmiotu należy zmienić na uncommon, nie wymaga innych zmian mechanicznych.
Scenariusz przygody częściowo opiera się na pregenach, na potrzeby naszych rozgrywek należy opracować w taki sposób aby uwzględnić dowolne postacie graczy. W szczególności za względu na założenie przez przygodę level upów w trakcie przygody (co u nas nie ma miejsca) początkowe encountery należy wyskalować w górę dla drużyn w większości drugopoziomowych, a końcowe osłabić dla drużyn pierwszopoziomowych.

1. W przygodzie nie występują skarby, więc należy użyć tabelki. Wyjątkiem jest jedno miejsce gdzie można zdobyć 200gp. Te 200gp należy odliczyć od nagrody z tabelki i przydzielić tylko jeśli postacie je znajdą.
2. Brak mechaniki  porywania postaci przez morze (tylko informacja, że jest 50% szans na złamanie się deski i postać odpływa 10ft co turę). Warto to wziąć pod uwagę przy planowaniu.
3. Ogólnie przygoda jest bardzo słabo napisana, występują niekonsekwencje w historii, brak jest skalowania encounterów (poza jednym). Prowadzenie niezalecane.

Jeden z bossów w przygodzie jest Arcane Tricksterem, którego statystyki wskazują na poziom 15. Nie ma on w stat blocku sneak attacku przez co jest prawie bezużyteczny w walce. Należy go traktować jakby miał Sneak Attack w następującym brzmieniu:
Sneak Attack (1/Turn): Rune deals an extra 8d6 damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 ft. of an ally of the Rune that isn't incapacitated and Rune doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

### [The Border Kingdoms: A Forgotten Realms Campaign Supplement](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/244431/The-Border-Kingdoms-A-Forgotten-Realms-Campaign-Supplement?affiliate_id=925821)

**Informacje o przygodzie**
According to the sage Meriadas of Westgate: “The Border Kingdoms are the most favored
destination for adventurers who want to proudly and boldly conquer a realm or establish their own
new kingdom. Lords, counts, dukes, kings and emperors rise, proclaim themselves, and are swept
away with the speed and regularity of waves crashing upon a shore.”
A legendary “frontier” corner of the Forgotten Realms, the Border Kingdoms are where adventurers
come to carve out their own kingdom, flee retribution, hide treasure — or find someone else's
treasure.
It is a hodgepodge of tiny realms ruled by kings, grand viziers, imperial overdukes, and all manner

of cabals, councils, and self-titled nobles. It's full of ruins, folk who want to stay hidden, long-
slumbering secrets, and adventures waiting to happen.

The Border Kingdoms is a valuable resource for Dungeon Masters and players alike. In addition to
describing the people and places of the Border Kingdoms, this book contains enough adventure
hooks and lore to keep adventuring parties busy for years.

this place, and champions from all over Faerûn would come to test their mettle. A blood-red beast
terrorizes the villages at night, and the normally stoic residents are quick to recruit able-bodied
heroes. Too bad you're not their first choice!

Well that’s odd. There sure are a lot of cats in the hamlet of Selpt. In fact, it seems as if just about
everyone has one, and boy do they pamper those cats. Even if you’ve never been a cat person, it’s
hard to say no. In fact, you should probably be adopted by one straight away. Yes, that’s it. You
belong to that cat. Who’s a pretty human?

Dodana nagroda za sukces dla jednego z graczy:
Potion of Irresistible Dance (Tier 2, Table D, Consumable)
This tropical drink straight from Chult tastes like mango and bananas. It’s unique flavor stems from

Przygoda ze względu na wiele potencjalnych torów gry wymaga dokładnego przeczytania i położenia nacisku na jasną ekspozycję sytuacji dla graczy.

### Shemshime's Bedtime Rhyme

**Informacje o przygodzie**
Shemshime's Bedtime Rhyme has been gathering dust on its shelf in Candlekeep for over six hundred years. The children's book arrived at the library in unceremonious fashion, though the same could not be said of its courier. Yowen Pilt, a procurer of rare books who did business with Candlekeep, was utterly insane when he arrived with his latest bundle. The records of the episode are sparse, but they report that he was placed in isolation for weeks after a "singing madness" began to spread among the library's Avowed. The records contain no further mention of the book dealer. The Avowed cataloged and shelved his final delivery, which included Shemshime's Bedtime Rhyme.
